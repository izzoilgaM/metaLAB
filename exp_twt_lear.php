			Metadata—pieces of information about information—are the librarian's and archivist's stock in trade. Call numbers, titles, keywords, place names, descriptions: all these turn an archive or book stack into a living collection to be browsed and read, searched and researched. Until quite recently, the technologies that we’ve used to record metadata and make them accessible—paper, gummed labels, rubber stamps, catalogue cards—have been passive. They're full of stories, and yet it takes the reader’s active fingers, eyes, and mind to tease those stories out and share them. New technologies exist that can lift metadata off the page, card, and spine to tell stories on their own. The old metadata were already telling stories, of course—stories of order, control, and connection. But in digital form, metadata can be made to leap and dance.<br><br>
The application below liberates metadata describing the collection of landscape works made by Edward Lear, held in Houghton Library’s Department of Printing and Graphic Arts (MS Typ 55.11). It was developed by Travis Bost (MDes '12), a new alumnus of Harvard's Graduate School of Design, where he learned to build programs that use data to tell interactive stories. As a curatorial innovation fellow with metaLAB at Harvard, Travis explored the finding aid of the collection, which thoroughly describes each item in detail, records its place and date of creation, and documents Lear's own organizational traces in the collection. Here, Travis takes that rich trove of metadata (created by Nancy Finlay, Houghton's erstwhile manuscripts curator) and sets it loose in an interactive visualization that exposes stories about Lear's career as a landscape artist: the places he visited, the kinds of materials he used, and his sheer creative output in different times and places. Travis’s application isn't meant to supersede Finlay’s finding aid, which offers descriptive and expository information, a bibliography, and a host of other schemes for understanding the collection; nor is it a fully-developed product or a stand-alone tool (and thus be warned: it may not work optimally with every system or browser environment). Instead, it's a kind of technology sketch, meant to pose questions and suggest avenues of research.  Increasingly, such venturesome and propositional technologies join traditional visual and textual means for scholars and students to explore literary and material culture—new ways for the researcher's hands and eyes to coax life from data.
